### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Frontend Developer

I have a strong foundation in a range of programming languages and frameworks including ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. I am skilled in utilizing design tools such as Figma to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces and am proficient in a variety of styling frameworks including Styled Components, TailwindCSS, Chakra UI, Sass, and Less.

I have experience integrating frontend systems with content management systems and working with both GraphQL and REST APIs.
