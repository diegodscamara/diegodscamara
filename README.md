### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Frontend Developer

As a Front End Developer, I have a passion for creating user-friendly interfaces using technologies such as ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and my design skills extend beyond coding, as Iâ€™m proficient in Figma to bring my visions to life. I integrate frontend systems with content management systems and have experience with both GraphQL and REST APIs. With expertise in Scrum, Kanban, Agile, and code versioning tools.

Additionally, I am proactive, skilled in conflict resolution, possess strong analytical and problem-solving skills, and have excellent communication skills that ensure project success. I work collaboratively as part of a team and mentor junior developers, while also dedicating myself to continuous improvement and making web applications more efficient as I'm always exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.
